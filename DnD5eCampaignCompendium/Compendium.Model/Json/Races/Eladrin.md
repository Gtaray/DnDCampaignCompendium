# Eladrin

Eladrin are graceful warriors and wizards from the Feywild who occasionally venture into the mortal worlds. Despite their humanoid appearance they are as fey as any other faerie, satyr, or sprite, and because of that they can be off-putting to mortals. More than anything else eladrin are creatures of magic, art, pleasure, and knowledge.

### Unburdened by Time

Eladrin are functionally immortal in that they do not die of old age; the magic that makes up their essence prevents that. Eladrin society is built on this singular trait more than any other. Eladrin spend the first 60 to 100 years of their life studying and training under their mentors. They are taught a variety of subjects and are forced to spend the time to perfect their skills. To any eladrin, if it is worth doing, it is worth doing perfectly.

In following with their lifespan the eladrin government has to keep track of information that can be several thousand years old, and keep it current. The solution to this problem is an uncountable number of rules, regulations, procedures, and guidelines forming a bureaucratic nightmare so convoluted and complex it would drive practically any mortal insane.

### Driven by Perfection

Eladrin have an innate desire to be the best at what they do. Some manage to shake this desire for a time, but it is always there. Partly in due to how much of their childhood is spent mastering their craft, but also because they are taught that what they do is art and it is meant to be beautiful. Casting a spell is only worth it if your runes are drawn perfectly, if your movements are graceful, and your words enchanting. A written book is worthless unless its text and illustrations are lovely to behold.

Mortals often find this attitude off-putting, and eladrin that deal with mortals eventually learn to live with the mortals' imperfection; some even find it charming. But there will always be a bit of guilt in letting something slip by when it could have been done better.

### Related to Faeries

Eladrin aren't like elves even though they both may be fey. They are more closely related to faeries and sprites. They have innate magical abilities, and can feel ebb and flow of arcane power around them. They can take pleasure in simple things, but can lose interest just as quick. Mortals find them flighty and unreliable because of this. Some eladrin can be tricksters, toying with mortals for their own amusement. Some remain aloof and calculating, possibly even conniving. An eladrin's smile is a veil for the calculating mind behind.

### Secluded and Secretive

Eladrin cities are often hidden from prying eyes, placed in out of the way spots that might be otherwise impossible to reach by mundane means. Their crystal towers grace the tops of mountains, or are built into underwater cliff-sides, or are buried so deep in the forest that you might as well have entered another world. Some scholars believe eladrin have cities that float through the air, miles above the ground. Regardless, chances are that without some help a mortal can't hope to set foot in their cities.

### Eladrin Traits

Your eladrin character has a variety of natural abilities in common with all other eladrin.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 2.

**Age.** Eladrin reach physical maturity after around 60 years, most of which is spent learning and studying. After this point the eladrin only shows signs of physical aging if it wants to, but otherwise is immortal and cannot die due to old age.

**Size.** Eladrin are tall and lithe, ranging under 6 feet to 6 and a half feet tall. Generally the older one gets, the taller they grow. Your size is Medium.

**Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

**Darkvision.** You are accustomed to the strange light of the feywild, where the night is darker than the deepest caverns. As such you have gained the ability to see in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of grey.

**Born of Magic.** You have proficiency in the Arcana skill.

**Fey Ancestry.** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

**Trance.** Eladrin don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does after 8 hours of sleep.

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write in Common and Fey.

**Subrace.** Eladrin have several cultures, the most distinct of which divide themselves based on their allegiance to specific archfey, and make up numerous different factions. Choose one of these subraces.

#### Summer Eladrin

Summer eladrin are beautiful as the midday sun, with shimmering hair and a radiant complexion. They are graceful and elegant. The Summer Queen, also called the Queen of Flowers or the Radiant Lady, is the matron of all the summer fey, and rules with a gentle hand. Summer eladrin are more likely to associate or live alongside mortals. A favorite hobby among summer fey is the practice of weaving calligraphy, magic, and swordplay together, using gilded swords to draw sigils to cast their spells.

#### Green Eladrin

The Green eladrin, also called the forest fey, are wild and untamed, like the lands they inhabit. They don't have a direct ruler, as other eladrin do, but rather they act in accordance with the desires of the earth, which they claim to be able to hear. The forest fey are capricious, prone to wild, sometimes violent, mood swings. They tend to see the mortal races the same way they look at any other animal.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 1.
